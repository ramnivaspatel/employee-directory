# Employee Directory Web Interface

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This is a frontend-only responsive application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Freemarker templates. It supports CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, search, and responsive layout.

## ðŸ’» Features

- List all employees
- Add/Edit/Delete employee details
- Search and filter employees
- Sort by First Name / Department
- Pagination options
- Responsive design

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

1. Open `index.ftl` using any Freemarker-compatible environment (e.g., Apache FreeMarker Java project).
2. If using plain HTML, you can simulate with hardcoded mock data.
3. Use `Live Server` in VSCode to preview pages.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- `/templates` â†’ Freemarker pages
- `/css` â†’ Styling
- `/js` â†’ Logic and mock data

## ðŸ¤” Reflection

- **Challenges**: Managing logic without a backend and syncing Freemarker with JS.
- **Improvements**: Add localStorage support, better filter UX, and reusable components.
